# Inzidenz Trend

This is a small web project, that renders a line chart for the historic trend of the 7-day-incidence of the COVID-19 cases in Germany. It's possible to compare graphs from states and districts in different time spans.

## Technology

The data from the RKI is aggregated in the [API of Marlon Lückert](https://api.corona-zahlen.org/docs/) and rendered in this react app with the [recharts library](https://recharts.org/en-US/).
